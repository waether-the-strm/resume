      I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;<strong>Frontend Developer</strong> and a&nbsp;<strong>Product
      Designer</strong>.<br /> I&nbsp;graduated in Product Design and after 4&nbsp;years of
      professional experience as a&nbsp;<strong>UI &amp; UX designer</strong>, I&nbsp;switched to
      a&nbsp;<strong>full-time developer</strong> role in 2015.
    - >
      I work mostly with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> &amp; <strong>UI
      Design</strong>. I specialize in <strong>bridging the gap between design and
      development</strong>, creating user-centered solutions that are both beautiful and functional.
      My unique background allows me to translate design vision into high-quality code while
      maintaining <strong>design system consistency</strong>. I&nbsp;would be particularly happy to
      cooperate on a&nbsp;<strong>design system project</strong>. Other fields of my current
      professional role interests: <strong>Product Designer</strong>, <strong>PM</strong> and
      <strong>QA</strong>.
    - >
      Based in <strong>Oslo</strong> since May 2024, learning Norwegian. I'm passionate about
      Norway's innovative tech scene and love exploring the country's amazing mountain trails in my
      free time.
    - >
      In&nbsp;my free time, I&nbsp;like to tinker, support friends with their projects, ride my
      <strong>motorcycle</strong>, <strong>climb</strong>, <strong>ski</strong>, and
      <strong>travel</strong> in my <strong>homemade micro rv</strong>. Recently, I&nbsp;started
      learning to skateboard, which brings me a&nbsp;lot of joy.<br /> I&nbsp;am very fond of
      <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>kombucha</strong>, and <strong>bread</strong> of my own
      baking.

        - >
          As a&nbsp;freelancer I'm cooperating with various parties, supporting commercial and
          non-profit projects. I&nbsp;have worked on projects supporting refugees. I&nbsp;organized
          a&nbsp;group of IT volunteers called WebScouts and supported more or less formal NGO
          organizations and grassroots initiatives. Together, we took part in accelerating the
          delivery of a&nbsp;Polish government website to support Ukraine.
        - >
          I&nbsp;led UX design exercises at the SWPS University in Warsaw, Department of Psychology
          and Computer Science. Commercially, I&nbsp;worked on the SAP UI for the US-based company –
          Corevist as a&nbsp;React Developer. Previously, I&nbsp;coordinated the redesign project of
          the web and mobile platform for Biletomat.pl, part of the Time For Friends Company. In
          this role, I&nbsp;led a&nbsp;team of designers, developers, and marketing professionals
          from a&nbsp;technical, coordination, and visual perspective, reporting directly to the
          company's management.
        - >
          Currently, I&nbsp;am leading the development of GSR (Sports Facility Reservation System)
          in collaboration with Ebert Studio. In this role, I&nbsp;am responsible for product
          design, UX/UI design, technical architecture, frontend development, and team coordination.
          The system is used by Sports and Recreation Centers across Poland, providing
          a&nbsp;modern, accessible, and user-friendly platform for facility reservations. I've
          built a&nbsp;comprehensive design system with reusable component libraries, established
          design tokens for consistent branding, and created design-to-code workflows that improved
          development efficiency while ensuring pixel-perfect implementation of user interfaces.

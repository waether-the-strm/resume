      I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;<strong>Frontend Developer</strong> and a&nbsp;<strong>Product Designer</strong>.<br /> I&nbsp;graduated in Product Design and after 4&nbsp;years of professional experience as a&nbsp;<strong>UI &amp; UX designer</strong>, I&nbsp;switched to a&nbsp;<strong>full-time developer</strong> role in 2015.
    - >
      I&nbsp;work mostly with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> &amp; <strong>UI Design</strong>. I&#39;m interested in <strong>high-quality</strong> projects focused strongly on the design, dedicated to regular internet users. I&nbsp;would be particularly happy to cooperate on a&nbsp;<strong>design system project</strong>. Other fields of my current professional role interests: <strong>QA</strong>, <strong>PM</strong>, and <strong>Product Designer</strong>.

      In&nbsp;May 2024, I&nbsp;moved from Warsaw to Oslo, and since September last year, I&nbsp;have been learning Norwegian.<br /> I&nbsp;love Norway for its landscapes and vast mountain trails, and it&nbsp;was here that I&nbsp;caught my first fish early this spring ðŸŽ£.
    - >
      In&nbsp;my free time, I&nbsp;like to tinker, support friends with their projects, ride my <strong>motorcycle</strong>, <strong>climb</strong>, <strong>ski</strong>, and <strong>travel</strong> in my <strong>homemade micro rv</strong>. Recently, I&nbsp;started learning to skateboard, which brings me a&nbsp;lot of joy.<br /> I&nbsp;am very fond of <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>kombucha</strong>, and <strong>bread</strong> of my own baking.

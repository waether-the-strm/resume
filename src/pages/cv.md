# Jan&nbsp;Mirecki • Frontend&nbsp;Developer

I am a&nbsp;**Frontend Developer** and a&nbsp;**Product Designer**. I&nbsp;graduated in Product Design and after 4&nbsp;years of professional experience as a&nbsp;**UI & UX designer**, I&nbsp;switched to a&nbsp;**full-time developer** role in 2015.

I work mostly with **React**, **TypeScript** & **UI Design**. I'm interested in **high-quality** projects focused strongly on the design, dedicated to regular internet users. I&nbsp;would be particularly happy to cooperate on a&nbsp;**design system project**. Other fields of my current professional role interests: **QA**, **PM**, and **Product Designer**.

In May 2024, I&nbsp;moved from Warsaw to Oslo, and since September last year, I&nbsp;have been learning Norwegian. I&nbsp;love Norway for its landscapes and vast mountain trails, and it was here that I&nbsp;caught my first fish early this spring 🎣.

In my free time, I&nbsp;like to tinker, support friends with their projects, ride my **motorcycle**, **climb**, **ski**, and **travel** in my **homemade micro rv**. Recently, I&nbsp;started learning to skateboard, which brings me a&nbsp;lot of joy. I&nbsp;am very fond of **coffee**, **kombucha**, and **bread** of my own baking.
